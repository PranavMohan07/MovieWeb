## Overview

This project is a simple movie search website that allows users to explore details about movies. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch movie information.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by title.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about each movie, including title, release date, synopsis, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and work well on various devices.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-website.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. Use the search bar to enter the title of the movie you want to search for.

4. Click on a movie from the search results to view its details.

## File Structure
